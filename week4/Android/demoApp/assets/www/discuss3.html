                    <strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</strong>
 
                    <p>The top selling app categories in the U.S. are game apps.</p>

                    <strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</strong>
 
                    <p>Some of the best selling app categories in Japan are utilities, like comic book readers, and handwritten note taking apps.</p>

                    <strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</strong>
 
                    <p>The top selling app categories in Great Britain are the paid apps that are dominated by games and the free apps by utilities.</p>
                
                    <strong>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</strong>

                    <p>Learning the information above I would have to say that building game applications are the way to go. Also while creating a game, make a little utility application on the side to get a more broad area on the market.</p>

                    <strong>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</strong>
 
                    <p>Percentages of Android users with the latest/greatest OS in -
                    U.S.: 41.66%
                    Japan: 44.18%
                    Great Britain: 21.39%
                    These stats could impact development by helping developers know what users are using and what is in more demand. They will also tell you in what countries would be best to deploy your application in first, to get the most success, or feedback.</p>
                

                    <strong>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</strong>
 
                    <p>USA: cost=$3.33 per month for 1mbps/bandwidth=4.8mbps
                    Japan: cost=$0.27 per month for 1mbps/bandwidth=61mbps
                    Great Britain: cost=$10 to $20 per month for 1mbps /bandwidth=3+mbps
                    This information could impact development within these countries as well as others because it limit’s the user in what he/she can accomplish, and that is why we must make our applications use the least amount of data to have the most success.<br /><a href="http://dailyinfographic.com/internet-speeds-around-the-world-infographic">Internet Speeds Around The World.</a></p><br />
                    
                    <strong>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</strong>
 
                    <p>(1) First and foremost I would have to go with create a game in the U.S. as it has the best results.</p>
 
                    <p>(2) Next would be Japan with a utility application, as it seems that Utility applications do the best there.</p>

                    <p>On a personal note I can’t help but wonder. I think creating a game takes a lot more time to make, than say, a utility. Would you spend most your dedication and time creating one game? Or several Utilities?</p>
