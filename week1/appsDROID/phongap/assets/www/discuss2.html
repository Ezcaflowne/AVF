        <h1>Accessibility: Week 2 Discussion</h1>

        <div>

                    <strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</strong>
 
                    <p>I would have to say, loose my multiple id tags with the same name, remove my inline JavaScript calls (big no no) Make more section tags for my other pages, like the instance with my Twitter search for my android, the sections I made for each tweet is a little deformed and I can see what some things don’t flow so well when you work from iOS to Android, or visa versa.
                    </p>
                

                    <strong><strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong></strong>

                    <p>I was watching Thunder screen reader demo, this is the first time that I have ever seen a blind person use a computer. I’ve got to say, wow it worked, the voice was a little annoying, even the guy was getting to that point. Maybe a way to make this better would be to alphabetize the links on the page. I like in the video the computer would say, “list item” before it read another link.
                As far as the mobile video goes, I only found the blackberry screen reader app video the one worth watching, as it was an actual demo video and not just some person in a high echo room with a video camera. Id say a mobile device that either A) uses brail keys with an OS that has been stripped of all the visual aspects, perhaps no screen at all just a phone with buttons all over the front of it. B) If one were to have a screen with no buttons like an iPhone perhaps having the built in apps setup in a certain order, and then anything else that is added would just be appended to the end of the list.</p>

                    <strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong>
 
                    <p>Accessibility is becoming more and more known now days, its a market thats just getting started and of course theres money to be made in a market thats so new. One thing that Im not sure qualifies as an accessibility device, but the other day I seen this device that you would put on the back of the deadbolt latch of your front door, and when you typed the code in correctly lets say for your front door on the iPhone app that goes with the device, the deadbolt would unlock, and the front door would be open. I thought this was very cool, less keys hooray!
                Another one I had personally used the other day for an older friend that couldnt see how much the bill was Macaroni Grill, I whipped out the old magnify app and zoomed it in for her, haha. It worked great though and she was shocked that it worked so well.</p>
                

                    <strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong>
 
                    <p>I had to go to my iPhones Accessibility menu just to see what they had. I went to it before way back when the ip4 first came out and I liked the inverted colors, just because I was new and didn’t know what jailbreaking was, it gave me something new to look at. As I look at it now on my ip5 I have got to say Hearing Aids it awesome feature, as my sister-in-laws dad owns a hearing aid company and makes me wonder if his product works with the iPhone. As for the Android I would have to say the text-to-speech feature is great for an accessibility app. This is also a feature on the iPhone but I do believe it came out first on the very first Droid, which made me a little uneasy being I just bought the iPhone and everyone was rubbing their Androids in my face… aye..</p>
